# Suggestion-Mining-from-Noisy-Data

Project work done at National University of Singapore (NUS) under the guidance of [Dr. Aditya Karanam](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/disa/bio/karanam/). 

The work includes detecting _Suggestion sentences_ and _Suggested features_ from noisy user comments. 

Checkpoints for the trained/fine-tuned models are available in the respective directories.

It is recommended to run all the code on a cuda compatible GPU for faster and efficient training.
